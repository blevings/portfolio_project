                <p>I have been interested in programming for a number of years, but have never had the opportunity to give time to it...until recently. This interest turned into a pro account on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy.com</a>.
                    With my love for learning in general and my past enjoyment of learning languages (bachelors degree in Biblical Languages), I quickly found I enjoy learning programming languages. I first tackled the beginner and intermediate Python
                    courses, along with the courses on Natural Language Processing, Pandas, and Exploratory Data Analysis. Although I really enjoyed these courses, I wanted to continue to expand my basic understanding of different languages. With that
                    goal in mind, I started the Full-Stack Engineer career path.

                    This website reflects what I have learned through this curriculum (along with a few google searches). Check out my projects below, my humble <a href="https://github.com/blevings" target="_blank">GitHub account</a>, or connect with
